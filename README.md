# scribbleData
Technical Assignment

This project is written to analyse youtube video data

## Data module
* Ensure sqlite is set in the system
* Execute the __init__ file
* Data for the selected column values will be stored in DB

## Common module
* The data stored can be viewed by executing the __init__ file

## Analyzer
* Input the column names for which analysis needs to be done
* Displays the video id based on the criteria selected

## [TODO]
* Make changes so that only a single module is directly interacting with DB
* Reduce DB calls
* Include more parameters in analysis
